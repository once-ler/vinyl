They reveal a motivation not to understand, but to accomplish a special task that only you were equipped to manage.\n\n\nNow step back.  Why do those toys look like that?  You tried to equate a 3 second clip of something popping up from a jar with the organic development of a grotesque, broken jack-in-the-box.  You completely ignore the unique story being told through that jack-in-the-box, both about its creation and its creator.  You ignore the incredibly unique and organic manner of its locomotion, because the jar had a thing in it the same way a box had a thing in it.\n\nYou did that with everything here.  You looked at the taxidermied characters in Alice, and saw the common element of toy-taxidermed monstrosities in the toys in Sid's room.  They were both inspired by taxidermy.\n\nWe don't \"reference\" things by crafting totally unique new things that fail to remind anyone of the thing even with photo \"evidence.\"  A \"reference\" would be \"whatever toy pieces they used to craft these things.\"  In plain sight, they're referencing known toy-types in a subverted configuration.  One that reminds viewers of their experiences with those things, while twisting the result.\n\nAnd look, the uncertainty of existence means that maybe one of the creative people involved *did* see the Alice flick.  It's an obscure animation film, so maybe.  \n\nThe point is, no.  This is not an obscure movie reference.  This is not an homage in function or construction.  This is a very common artifact of having a human brain that you're continuing to confuse with insight.  Hell, humans have been mashing different toy parts together longer than the Toy Story movies have been around, I'm sure you could find some even more compelling examples of \"Toy Taxidermy\" that are also unrelated to Toy Story or the toys in Sid's room.\n\nQuit it.

{"title":"Not understanding the Wonder Woman hype","comments":[{"body":"**Spoilers through-out**\n\nWonder Woman is deeper than it appears at first glance. Yes, it has contrived plot elements and relies gratuitous CGI but those are the things that will sell ticket and put asses in seats: simple story and visual spectacle. Where you start to glimpse the depths, the narrative wealth, of the movie is in how it treats its protagonist-- the Woman.\n\nThere's a fantastic video by [Pop Culture Detective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thpEyEwi80) that attempts to define an existing trope in our media culture. He calls it \"Born Sexy Yesterday\" and its about female characters of extraordinary ability who are naive and uneducated in the ways of the world. They might be the focus of the story, the action star of the movie or show, but their inexperience means they must be guided through the world by a knowledgeable man. This is a very common trope, as he points out, in Anime but its very true in our media as well.\n\nAs the narrative Wonder Woman kicks in and we see Diana introduced to the real world she is child-like in her glee at simple things like babies and ice cream. She is quite literally guided by a man in just about every scene as Trevor has a hand on her back and pushes her along or grabs her by the arm and pulls her with him. She goes where he goes, she does what he says must be done, and is made to follow his lead even though we know she's a very accomplished fighter and posses great innate magical power. Towards the end of Act II this trope begins to be subverted. Diana, increasingly at odds with Trevor over his control against what she so strongly believes, makes her own choices and the men begin to follow her and meet with great success as a result. For the rest of the film, Steve Trevor's control over her is diminished and broken down until she is a self-reliant, self-motivated woman.\n\nThat's the real interesting part of this film. Most female protagonists are displayed through the lens of a masculine point of view. They are written by and for men. Black Widow, for example, is a no-non sense beauty with a dark streak but really isn't all the much different from her male counterparts. Diana was written in this story as something entirely else. She is raised by women, she is trained to fight by women, she is educated by a female ruler, and when she enters the real world-- the world of men-- she is clearly not in line with them and she refuses to assimilate. She knows what is right and what is wrong and she doesn't let a man tell her what is what. This is a story about a woman and its told by a woman for an audience that includes women. That is something rare in Hollywood, its certainly rare in action films, and its almost non-existent in superhero films. \n\nSo, for all its cliche plot points and contrived circumstances (and believe me I have a few complaints of my own), Wonder Woman brings something new to the screen that I hope we see more of. We get enough Captain Kirk machismo and Bruce Wayne gruffness, lets give our lady-friends some heroes they can feel proud in like Furiosa and Wonder Woman. ","author":{"username":"Fofolito","commentKarma":46386}},{"body":"&gt; Steve and Diana leave the island on a small boat. A few minutes previously it is stated that he has no idea where they are (where the island is). They then set sail for London. How does he know how to sail to London if he doesn't know where they are?\n\nI believe this can be explained by the fact that the stuff confounding Steve's compass is part of whatever is hiding the Amazons' island from the rest of the world. Once they're out past that field or whatever it is, presumably the compass starts working again and he can get his bearings based on the stars.\n\nUltimately, I feel like it was pretty successful, if only because character chemistry was never overdone or painfully corny, and because Gal Godot's portrayal of WW as someone naive, but not *stupid* was pretty believable. The tropes that do exist are usually tongue in cheek - Dr. Poison and the general do a villain laugh, for instance, but there's a *reason* for them to do so.","author":{"username":"bobtehpanda","commentKarma":3130}},{"body":"Watching a movie with you doesn't sound very fun","author":{"username":"Ailite","commentKarma":10351}},{"body":"It's horrifyingly overrated, but for all the right reasons.
