They reveal a motivation not to understand, but to accomplish a special task that only you were equipped to manage.\n\n\nNow step back.  Why do those toys look like that?  You tried to equate a 3 second clip of something popping up from a jar with the organic development of a grotesque, broken jack-in-the-box.  You completely ignore the unique story being told through that jack-in-the-box, both about its creation and its creator.  You ignore the incredibly unique and organic manner of its locomotion, because the jar had a thing in it the same way a box had a thing in it.\n\nYou did that with everything here.  You looked at the taxidermied characters in Alice, and saw the common element of toy-taxidermed monstrosities in the toys in Sid's room.  They were both inspired by taxidermy.\n\nWe don't \"reference\" things by crafting totally unique new things that fail to remind anyone of the thing even with photo \"evidence.\"  A \"reference\" would be \"whatever toy pieces they used to craft these things.\"  In plain sight, they're referencing known toy-types in a subverted configuration.  One that reminds viewers of their experiences with those things, while twisting the result.\n\nAnd look, the uncertainty of existence means that maybe one of the creative people involved *did* see the Alice flick.  It's an obscure animation film, so maybe.  \n\nThe point is, no.  This is not an obscure movie reference.  This is not an homage in function or construction.  This is a very common artifact of having a human brain that you're continuing to confuse with insight.  Hell, humans have been mashing different toy parts together longer than the Toy Story movies have been around, I'm sure you could find some even more compelling examples of \"Toy Taxidermy\" that are also unrelated to Toy Story or the toys in Sid's room.\n\nQuit it.  Other comments have nicely tried to educate your brain on its misstep.  Now this one is too.\n\n\n*Edited for edits",

                "body": "**Spoilers through-out**\n\nWonder Woman is deeper than it appears at first glance. Yes, it has contrived plot elements and relies gratuitous CGI but those are the things that will sell ticket and put asses in seats: simple story and visual spectacle. Where you start to glimpse the depths, the narrative wealth, of the movie is in how it treats its protagonist-- the Woman.\n\nThere's a fantastic video by [Pop Culture Detective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thpEyEwi80) that attempts to define an existing trope in our media culture. He calls it \"Born Sexy Yesterday\" and its about female characters of extraordinary ability who are naive and uneducated in the ways of the world. They might be the focus of the story, the action star of the movie or show, but their inexperience means they must be guided through the world by a knowledgeable man. This is a very common trope, as he points out, in Anime but its very true in our media as well.\n\nAs the narrative Wonder Woman kicks in and we see Diana introduced to the real world she is child-like in her glee at simple things like babies and ice cream. She is quite literally guided by a man in just about every scene as Trevor has a hand on her back and pushes her along or grabs her by the arm and pulls her with him. She goes where he goes, she does what he says must be done, and is made to follow his lead even though we know she's a very accomplished fighter and posses great innate magical power. Towards the end of Act II this trope begins to be subverted. Diana, increasingly at odds with Trevor over his control against what she so strongly believes, makes her own choices and the men begin to follow her and meet with great success as a result. For the rest of the film, Steve Trevor's control over her is diminished and broken down until she is a self-reliant, self-motivated woman.\n\nThat's the real interesting part of this film. Most female protagonists are displayed through the lens of a masculine point of view. They are written by and for men. Black Widow, for example, is a no-non sense beauty with a dark streak but really isn't all the much different from her male counterparts. Diana was written in this story as something entirely else. She is raised by women, she is trained to fight by women, she is educated by a female ruler, and when she enters the real world-- the world of men-- she is clearly not in line with them and she refuses to assimilate. She knows what is right and what is wrong and she doesn't let a man tell her what is what. This is a story about a woman and its told by a woman for an audience that includes women. That is something rare in Hollywood, its certainly rare in action films, and its almost non-existent in superhero films. \n\nSo, for all its cliche plot points and contrived circumstances (and believe me I have a few complaints of my own), Wonder Woman brings something new to the screen that I hope we see more of. We get enough Captain Kirk machismo and Bruce Wayne gruffness, lets give our lady-friends some heroes they can feel proud in like Furiosa and Wonder Woman. ",

                "body": "&gt; Steve and Diana leave the island on a small boat. A few minutes previously it is stated that he has no idea where they are (where the island is). They then set sail for London. How does he know how to sail to London if he doesn't know where they are?\n\nI believe this can be explained by the fact that the stuff confounding Steve's compass is part of whatever is hiding the Amazons' island from the rest of the world. Once they're out past that field or whatever it is, presumably the compass starts working again and he can get his bearings based on the stars.\n\nUltimately, I feel like it was pretty successful, if only because character chemistry was never overdone or painfully corny, and because Gal Godot's portrayal of WW as someone naive, but not *stupid* was pretty believable. The tropes that do exist are usually tongue in cheek - Dr. Poison and the general do a villain laugh, for instance, but there's a *reason* for them to do so.",

What I didn't expect is for the film to be decent.  Warner Bros has dropped the ball with most of their interpretations of these characters.  This movie was finally on a par with an average Marvel film.  I enjoyed it.  She was solid and the supporting cast (especially Chris Pine) made it fun.  I'd give it a solid 61 out of 100.  It's getting some extra hype rightfully so because it's a female lead and female director, but beyond that it was pretty much a mashup of Thor 1 and Captain America 1.  Standard superhero movie. ",

Another example would /r/gaming vs /r/truegaming - visit them both to see the difference. In /r/movies you will have 6000 people a day that want to talk about Leonardo cutting his hand and how they can't be the only one that likes Prometheus, it's going to happen.

David Lynch decided to turn the footage into a film full of dead ends and useless story elements. People applauded it for being more than meets the eye and a revelatory experience once you \"finally understand it\". But in my experience, when asking these I-understand-Mullholland-Drivers for explanations, you'll simply get a downvote and a deflective response claiming \"open your mind, don't think of the film as a straight narrative\" or some other useless statement. Mullholland Drive lovers love not explaining Mullholland Drive, says a lot. The short answer is your questions don't have answers, the film is a weird and wonderful journey into the mind of David Lynch to some, and a pointless empty film to others.\n\nJust imagine David Lynch has ADHD and Mullholland Drive will makes perfect sense.",

              {
                "body": "The book, the original movie, and the remake are all very different creatures.\n\nThe book (Lem, 1961):\n\nRussian story about how aliens are so alien that no matter what we do, they are irrevocably alien and have such an alien framework to their experiences, concepts, communication, and identity that humans communicating with such an alien entity are either likely to experience failure due to the futility of the task, or be driven mad by and unable to communicate the experience.\n\nHumans see projected representations 'visitors' (Also, nobody can see anybody else's visitors, so you're essentially isolated in your experience of the Otherness) of people they know and the humans try to communicate with the representations, rather than with the alien through them.\nAlso, the alien consciousness eventually communicates with the main character after they beam his consciousness at the ocean, the visitor realises she's doing more harm than good, and helps them kill her (and all of her kind) so there will be no more visitor-class entities, but the two species will go on coexisting and thinking about eachother but never again communicating. Mainguy eventually leaves the planet after spending a day flying over the ocean and thinking about religion. Also, throughout the book mainguy reads and summarizes a _lot_ of books about the planet, all of which essentially boil down to \"We still have no idea what is happening on this planet\".\nSo Solaris is not just a book in which not much happens; it is a whole multitude of books in which not much happens. The non-action is layered and cerebral.\n\nThemes:\n\nReducing the Other into human concepts, images, and ideas is inappropriate as Otherness is otherness, fundamentally and always. Otherness is not necessarily a mirror of humanness, just a warped sounding board for discovering the limits of humanity, human intelligence, and human concepts. Heavy focus on xenobiology &amp; philosophy, shaped by the sixties Soviet culture.\n\n\nFirst movie (Tarkovsky, 1972):\n\nThe Solaris station is already jam-packed with crazy people, driven mad by the planet beforehand. Newguy (recently widowed from Earth) gets to know the crazy people and the planet recreates his dead wife from his memories, potentially she's just a (super-crazy, super-clingy, super strong, invulnerable) recreation based on his -idea- of his wife, rather than a true replica.\nShe kills herself a couple of times, guy experiences some grief at the fact he can't save his dead wife, has some sex with her, and eventually everybody on the station gets the idea that killing off her kind might be a good idea. So they do. They beam his brain at the planet, the planet starts creating little islands, mainguy lives out his days on a perfect little island with his visitor\\deadwife.\n\nThemes:\n\nOtherness is weird. Russians are weird. That Russians relating to otherness doesn't lend itself well to Western cinema. Regret, grief, erotic funtimes with superpowered women are kind of cool, but eventually you have to vaporise her and replace her with something more relatable. Bonus points if she comes with her own house and fitout, because space stations are cramped and sometimes its good to get away from the farming collectives.\n\nSecond movie (Soderberg, 2002):\n\nIs it a drama? Is it sci-fi? Is it a lesson in pretentious remakes? The director couldn't decide, so made that your job.\nThe basics from the plot are there, but its nothing like the book. Mostly its about Clooney's grief and guilt over his suicidal dead wife, and learning that he has to let go. Until suddenly he doesn't, because its Hollywood, where enjoying a few extra hours with a fake dead wife is better than personal growth and _getting off the crashing space station_. There's also a brief part where crashing the space station is deemed essential because letting the effects of Otherness\\resurrected-spouse-madness back into human society would be bad if it happened on a global scale\n\nThemes:\n\nDead wives should stay dead wives, except if you have a resurrection machine\\planet, then its a handy kind of personal therapy, but its highly addictive.\n\n\nEven the book's author claims all the movies so far are just stories about people having erotic\\personal problems in space, and nothing to do with his central theme, that communicating with aliens will be nigh-impossible due to differences.\n",

I am completely fine with the modern take on the world that Robert Neville lives in for the movie (the novel is set in the 70s). That's not a problem, and it even makes for an interesting first act. However, the seams begin to come undone in the second act, and by the third, it's been butchered and tossed aside for something else entirely. The entire point of the novel -- the thing that makes Neville legend -- is completely lost within this adaptation to the point of uncertainty of whether or not I would even call it an adaptation. Even the alternate version doesn't quite hammer it home in the same way that the novel manages to do.\n\nI would love to see a remake of it in another 10 years or so -- one that follows the beautiful groundwork that the book gives us. Until then, the movie is fine on its own merits, but having read the book makes it really hurt the experience of watching the film by seeing them throw away what could have been.",

It's still a movie about a billionaire who dresses up in an outfit and fights crime. It isn't Heat or CSI: Gotham, nor should it be. I appreciate what the Nolan Batman films did for the genre and essentially resurrecting Batman from the absurd silliness it had de-evolved into, but I realized I don't actually *like* them and all of the \"it's more than what it really is!\" turns me off.\n\nPlus, The Dark Knight is another one of those movies where the questionable writing and general sloppiness of it creeps in more after it sits with you for a while. The dialogue kind of stinks and isn't performed particularly well, especially from Christian Bale. It feels like they rush through lines to hurry up and get to the next set piece. And for a superhero movie, that's fine, but for a superhero movie that thinks it *isn't* a superhero movie, it doesn't work.",

What are these characters even going to do when they team up? Fight a giant CGI Satan or something?\n\nAs far as I know the only time these characters weren't standalone was in campy horror/comedy crossovers in the 50's and Van Helsing starring Hugh Jackman.\n\nThere are better ideas that Universal could have used to kick off a CU, like, I don't know, Egyptian/Norse/Greek Mythology or something. Those stories are basically superhero comics from Ancient times anyway.",

Ludendorff might as well have been named Baron Von Evil Dorf Man. And he shouldn't have been in an actual fight scene.I thought that the twist with Ares being the English politician was good but I expected him to change his appearance....but he stayed as a English politician in Metal armor which looked ridiculous and it was hard to take seriously. \n\nThey should have given the general a better motive, maybe he's not really evil but realizes that the armistice would cripple Germany more and wants to defend Germany at all costs or something like that. Make him somewhat relatable. Make Ares go all Sauron and give him a more demonic appearance and I think that would make the fight scene with him overall less comical.",

If your primary directive was to send a machine into the past to end the resistance and after sending the machine, you're still fighting that same resistance but something has changed, you'll know that you failed to kill John. With each movie, the future machines have changed because of their impact in the past and discovery of future tech by past engineers. \n\nIt's why Sarah Connor attempts to kill the guy who discovers the arm and builds a whole company around the tech found in it. A number of years later, when John is much older, the machines attempt one more time to kill John right before the world ends.\n\nIf you watch all of the movies in sequence, you'll notice a pattern that as the machines keep failing, their future tech adapts and changes. I'd imagine that the time gaps was primarily to adapt to newer technologies as well as to prevent a time paradox.\n\nI welcome other thoughts about this as well.",

It's kind of weird how the movie makes the war feel current when it's like the equivalent of Frodo going inside a time portal at the end of Return of the King to stop a terminator from changing the past.\n\nAnother thing that is broken is that surely the second the terminator is sent back how come there's time for the resistance to send someone back? The past should've changed completely/their timeline deleted unless they're doing the whole \"create a parallel timeline by changing the past\".\n\nIt's not like 2029 and 1984 were happening concurrently. It's a bit like the opposite of Parting of the Ways in Doctor Who, why does Rose travel forwards in time further ahead than when she was originally sent back instead of a few seconds after she originally left? She could've saved more people.",

It immediately takes me out of the action and reminds me of far worse movies.  It also feels out of place... as if WW's director added those scenes in at Snyder's request.

I feel like slow motion is most often used as a way to make sure the viewer appreciates the feat or event being shown, which to me is not only irritating but also insulting. It's like a way to add exposition without words, treating the audience like fools that can't tell that something amazing is happening unless you spell it out for them. There are two instances (with exceptions, obviously) where it is justified in my opinion, and that's when something is moving too fast to be seen otherwise, or in an extremely emotional moment and a slower speed is used to show an altered state of perception.",

I hope we find out in Justice League, or Wonder Woman 2.\n\nQuestion 2, she didn't confront Zod because she hadn't been tempted out of hiding yet. She came to Gotham in Batman v. Superman to get the picture of herself and Steve that was taken in Belgium, 1918. That picture was really important to her. She was also literally leaving Gotham when Doomsday attacked, its proximity to her likely made it hard for her to stay away. She couldn't rationalize being in hiding any longer, it was all too easy to get to the fight. Meanwhile she could have been thousands of miles away during Zod's attack. \n\nQuestion 3, Diana didn't know about the spear, she didn't know Doomsday was weak to it, and she didn't know Superman was weak to it either. Superman picked up the spear and flew into Doomsday after rescuing Lois and finding the spear. Meanwhile Wonder Woman was holding Doomsday in place with her lasso. TL:DR, she was busy!\n\nQuestion 4, I saw Hippolyta's statement, \"If you leave, you may never return\" as a dark prediction, a deepset fear of hers. She wasn't kicking Diana out or drawing a line in the sand, but emotionally communicating her fear that Diana may be killed by man or Ares, if she leaves Themyscira. \n\nAnd then the fifth question is Justice League hype, which of course there is no answer for just yet.",

Donnie is described as being the \"Living Receiver\", and is granted superpowers such as strength, telekinesis and premonition. Donnie's task over the course of the film is to return the jet engine (called the \"Artifact\" in the book) to the Primary Universe to avert a disaster. During his quest, he is aided by \"The Manipulated Living\" and \"The Manipulated Dead\", who are the other characters in the film.",

He and his wife, Elizabeth Holloway Marston, lived with a third woman — Olive Byrne — in a polyamorous relationship. Both Elizabeth and Olive greatly helped inspire Wonder Woman through their feminist beliefs (which William shared) as well as their shared enjoyment of things like “love binding.” Suddenly all of those whips and bondage scenes make sense …\n&gt; \n&gt; The movie will star Luke Evans as Marston, Rebecca Hall as his wife, and Bella Heathcote as their shared lover. \n\n&gt; The film, written and directed by Angela Robinson (True Blood, The L Word), also stars Connie Britton and Oliver Platt, and will be distributed by Annapurna Pictures. There is a lot to explore with the subject matter, and you can get a brief overview from this NPR story, “The Man Behind Wonder Woman Was Inspired By Both Suffragists And Centerfolds.”\n\n\n[Official site](http://professorm.movie/)",
